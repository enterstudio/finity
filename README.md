# Finity

**Finity** is a very simple and slim state machine derived from **transitions**,
a great state machine implementation tightly integrated with ActiveRecord
by Jakub Kuźma and Timo Rößner.

[https://github.com/troessner/transitions][transitions]

The goal of **Finity** is to provide a state machine implementation which is as
slim and fast as possible while trying to maintain a beautiful and readable syntax
with the help of procs and blocks.
